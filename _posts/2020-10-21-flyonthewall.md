Analyze the observations and notes you described in your response to number 1 to formulate insights, questions, and theories about the environment and users that you observed.
Use a framework such as AEIOU, or simply form associations by clustering different observations in groups based on categories that you define. 
This AEIOU worksheet may also be helpful.

Describe your process in finding these answers.
Include details such as who you worked with, what methods you tried, what worked or didnâ€™t work, what could have gone better, and what you learned during this lab.

HM Online and on-campus are highly different. On HM Online, people acted completely different due to the different environment, In Zoom, most people seemed distant
and only stared at their screens, seldomly taking notes and interacting with the teacher. The environment was electronically based so no one had to commute
Moreover, because people were in their home environment, they seemed less talkative and paid more attention. Unfortunately, because everyone was on their own, 
students worked individually, though occasionally did text other students for help. Zoom, the software HM Online used, was an electronically based webcam where
there was often lag due to unstable connections. Barriers also muted the audio from people. However, students did not have to spend too long on their computers
as the schedule for classes greatly decreased, giving us more frees and time off the screen to do homework. All this had to happen because the coronavirus was
spread to a faculty member, and everyone had to quarantine for 14 days and get another covid-19 test.
On the campus, people could walk, interact, and chat with others, though socially distanced. The school had a more engaging environment compared to the HM Online as 
most students understand that school is an environment for studying and work. Compared to HM Online, the school was more engaging and interactive; students talked with
their school personalities, acting completely different than they were at home. In school, there are many different objects to protect students: Social distancing dots
are located as place markers for students to stand, barriers between chairs are present to decrease the chance of spreading a disease, and everyone has to use masks to
protect themselves and others around them. However, it was harder for teachers and students to identify others because of the masks and both students and teachers seemed
more content being at school than at home.

On HM Online, because people seemed more wary and introverted talking to the teacher, I believe it is because we don't feel as comfortable having our school personality
and our home personality clash, mainly because we act differently at home and at school. It would be awkward to act like you were at school with your friends whilst next to
your parents, and the same would be true vice versa. However, one thing I did not understand was when a teacher asked a question, there might be a dead silence for a couple
of seconds. I don't believe no one had an answer to the teacher's question, but I believe no one actually wants to speak, as again, it would be awkward to act like you are at 
school when you're at home, even though that is the situation.

there were dots to social distance, there was a field as a landmark where people would interact with each other, though there is also more littering because
many people socialize on the field. 
, but people cared less about their environment as it is 
natural that we care more about our homes than a public area. To combat this, teachers send emails to the entire school, ordering the disposal of the garbage.
