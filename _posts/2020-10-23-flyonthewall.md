HM Online and on-campus are highly different. On HM Online, people acted completely different due to the different environment, In Zoom, most people seemed distant
and only stared at their screens, seldomly taking notes and interacting with the teacher. The environment was electronically based so no one had to commute
Moreover, because people were in their home environment, they seemed less talkative and paid more attention. Unfortunately, because everyone was on their own, 
students worked individually, though occasionally did text other students for help. Zoom, the software HM Online used, was an electronically based webcam where
there was often lag due to unstable connections. Barriers also muted the audio from people. However, students did not have to spend too long on their computers
as the schedule for classes greatly decreased, giving us more frees and time off the screen to do homework. All this had to happen because the coronavirus was
spread to a faculty member, and everyone had to quarantine for 14 days and get another covid-19 test.
On the campus, people could walk, interact, and chat with others, though socially distanced. The school had a more engaging environment compared to the HM Online as 
most students understand that school is an environment for studying and work. Compared to HM Online, the school was more engaging and interactive; students talked with
their school personalities, acting completely different than they were at home. In school, there are many different objects to protect students: Social distancing dots
are located as place markers for students to stand, barriers between chairs are present to decrease the chance of spreading a disease, and everyone has to use masks to
protect themselves and others around them. However, it was harder for teachers and students to identify others because of the masks and both students and teachers seemed
more content being at school than at home.

On HM Online, because people seemed more wary and introverted talking to the teacher, I believe it is because we don't feel as comfortable having our school personality
and our home personality clash, mainly because we act differently at home and at school. It would be awkward to act like you were at school with your friends whilst next to
your parents, and the same would be true vice versa. However, one thing I did not understand was when a teacher asked a question, there might be a dead silence for a couple
of seconds. I don't believe no one had an answer to the teacher's question, but I believe no one actually wants to speak, as again, it would be awkward to act like you are at 
school when you're at home, even though that is the situation.
On the campus, ironically, people seemed more at home; this fact is because we are supposed to learn during school hours and people would get that sense more if we were at
school than at home. However, because people now felt more compelled to be themselves at school, there are multiple occasions where they do not pay attention and talk to 
their friends. Therefore, people would spend free periods to do work but mainly chat with others, unless they had to prepare for assessments. However, there were times when
a person would be wandering around campus, neither doing work nor socializing. I do not have a definite answer why, but I do think it is because their friends would either
not have a free and they did not have any work to do or because they would rather be alone than talk with others.

During my experience on HM Online, I saw these observations, where no one would talk, glitches would occur, in all my classes. Even if there were people that talked and
interrupted non stop during class, they would be as silent as everyone else. However, when put in breakout rooms, people would talk more and interact with each other. 
I tried to change some of these problems, by either talking more with the teacher or moving to the location where the internet was best, but neither would work.
I learned that people on HM Online are more introverted and a worse and more quiet environment to be educated in compared to on campus.
Coming back to campus, I saw the problems, where littering would occur, students interrupted teachers, less work was being done, during my experiences being back in class.
During my walk around campus with Chris and Ben, we saw people more relaxed on the field and more jubilant. We tried to go against the social norm by going to the BBQ 
walk-in at 2:50 to get some food, but everything stayed the same; no one seemed to care nor pay any attention. I learned that people, students and teachers, are more happy 
staying in school to do work, socialize, or just waste time because they are in the presence of others.
