title: Good vs. Bad Design

---

There are many pencils that are either good or bad in design, have a look at this pencil:

This pencil is too small and tiny where you cannot put your hand on it. Additionally, the pencil tip is too sharp, meaning it is very susceptible to breaking easily so you will have to resharpen the pencil again. This resharpening will make the pencil so small that it will be not usable. Finally, because you will probably never use this pencil, the eraser will get very dirty and no longer erase anything. In the future, when you have not used this pencil after a couple of weeks, the eraser will be so bad that it will smudge what you wanted to erase with the dirt it accumulated for the past few weeks.

Now, take a look at this pencil:

The pencil is perfectly long so your hand can fit on the shaft of the pencil. The eraser is perfect in that it will never flake or get dirty. The pencil has a built in sharpener so you will not need to buy a pencil sharpener. It is also not made out of normal pencil material so it is much more durable. Finally, the pencil tip is always perfect not just because of the pencil sharpener, but also the fact that the tip has its own cap, so it is much harder to dullen.
